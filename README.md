# plot2D2D
Function to plot 2D data [u,v] at 2D locations [x,y]. Useful for vector fields, complex numbers etc.

Highlights:
* The function lets you choose from 7 different colormaps, two of which are for circular data. This is especially useful for angle/magnitude plots.
* The function returns a function handle to the plot and can generate a colormap as a subfigure, as an individual figure or not at all.
* By adding an image custom.png to the folder, you can easily use your own colormap.
* Four examples (commented in the code) demonstrate how to use the function
* Works with scattered data

Remarks:
* The figures will most likely need some postprocessing before they are presentable
* The use of the circular colormap ChromaMax is discouraged as it can create unintenional edges and highlights in the plot. But is more vivid than ChromaConst.  
* Ticks of the colormap plot are currently fixed to ticks at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the values.
